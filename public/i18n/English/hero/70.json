    "story": "A pair of technomagical boots made mainly with the Magic Stone of Tempest excavated from the ancient technomagic ruins. Whenever their wearer attacks, the magic stone releases an energy wave that allows the wearer to achieve supersonic speed and a power destructive enough to bend metal pillars like taffy. In fact, it was Ricardo who gave Cecilia the Magic Stone of Tempest, the core material of these boots. According to her, Ricardo was keeping it safe, though he never told her where he got it. One day, Ricardo came to visit Cecilia in the Empire, and Cecilia told him that she would join the Resistance. He saw from her eyes that her mind was set. He then gave her the Magic Stone of Tempest, saying, 'Show the world what you believe in.' Later, Landet, the geek engineer of the Resistance recognized the value of the Magic Stone and created these powerful boots."
