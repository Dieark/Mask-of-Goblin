  "story": "A genius scholar from the Tower of Sage who remembers everything she sees. After developing her own theories and systems of Rune Magic, she quickly grew bored and moved onto a different subject. Soon, she was appointed as the highest ranking royal secretary of finance. Unfortunately, many politicians refused to accept a commoner as their superior. After many lies and ill rumors, Veronica eventually decided to leave the palace on her own. But this was hardly a defeat for her, and she soon set out to conquer a new path. She headed to the Orvel Guild Alliance, where she would be measured only by her abilities and nothing else. As expected, her incredible perception and analytical skills made her an indispensable asset to numerous guilds.",

The letters that are written by the writer cannot be erased without the writer's mana. Also, text can be written on the magic parchment without any limit, and it has a function to search for stuff one has written before. It makes Veronica's work that much more effective. Of course, it's useful when it's used for work, but outside of work..."
