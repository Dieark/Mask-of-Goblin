  "story": "Born in a noble family in Penteonia, Bernheim von Lachelima was gifted with outstanding martial skills. He had the strength of a giant and excellent judgment, so it was undeniable that he would make a great knight. However, he had a fatal flaw that kept him from being successful in Penteonia: He could not use the power of light at all. No matter how hard he tried, how strong his faith and will were, the power of light did not answer to his calling. Although all he ever wanted was to serve his nation and the Queen, the fact that his incapability was keeping him from being more than a low-level knight frustrated him. Bernheim did not give up and trained hard to handle the power of light, but his constant lack of progress slowly started to weaken his mind. One day, he visited the Central Church to study the power of light and its mechanism. It was when he was quietly reading a book that he heard a sound. It was an angelic voice calling for him. The long-accumulated frustration of Bernheim led him to where the voice was coming from, a room sealed with multiple magic barriers in the basement of the church. As he moved closer to it, the barriers vanished as if they were never there. What he saw inside the room was a sword in the shape of an angel, exuding blinding light. 'You are the chosen one', said the sword, drawing him near with holy light. Thinking that his relentless effort had finally paid off, he slowly grasped the sword. Then, his mind was drawn into the deepest darkness. The darkness that captured himâ€”it was the endless shadowy void of futility. A vessel that could never be filled; a whole other universe. In the vast darkness, Bernheim felt his mind deteriorating and his existence fading away. His mind and body was slowly being encroached by a dark, ominous power. However, Bernheim was also one of the Penteonian Knights, a Knight of Light who swore not to be defeated by darkness. He rose from the shrouding darkness, regaining consciousness with his indomitable spirit. When he came to his senses, lying on the floor, there was a giant black sword in his hand. The demonic sword with the appearance of a demon was laughing and mocking the knight who broke away from the path of light. Eventually, Bernheim was banished from Penteonia, and he started to live a new life as a mercenary in Vespia Empire with that malicious, foul-mouthed demonic sword in his hand...",

    "story": "The name of this demonic sword means 'the one who cannot be satiated' and 'the one with ceaseless craving.' It has the power to absorb all forms of energy, evil or holy, to use them as its own. It has its own will, and a character that is very temperamental, scatterbrained, and cruel. Even Queen Artemia does not know the exact reason why this demonic sword was sealed under the Central Church in Penteonia, but rumor says that Targarios was a Dark Lord in the distant past. Considering its frivolous character, that might seem unlikely. However, there is no doubt that it has devastating powers."
