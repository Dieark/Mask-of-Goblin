  "description": "The youngest instructor of the Guild Allied Forces who trains soldiers of the Alliance from the Command Center. Also being a genius at weapon modifications and strategy planning, she utilizes her own handcrafted firearms to lay waste to the enemies.",
  "story": "Hanus was only 13 when the Guild Allied Forces recruited her. She is known as the legendary girl who was also called as the little giantess of the battlefield. As the daughter of the guild master of a weapon guild, Hanus used to play with discarded firearms and blades when she was young. This is when the others discovered her ingenuity in arms. The Guild Alliance decided that they cannot allow such profound talent to go to waste. The Alliance, after barely managing to convince Hanus' father who fiercely disagreed with the Alliance's decision, recruited her. Hanus was trained along with other soldiers, and just as the Guild had expected, she displaced her talent on battlefield. Hanus' revolutionary weapons were ridiculously strong enough to shift the paradigm of warfare. Her craftmanship, combined with her masterful tactics, marked the birth of an ultimate soldier of the Allied Forces. Moreover, Hanus herself vastly enjoyed her life in the army, as she could utilize her handcrafted weapons to their fullest. However, great talent meant more demands and battles to fight. During an operation, Hanus ended up being wounded. Upon hearing this news about her daughter's injury, Hanus' father who detested seeing his daughter in the army ever since the early days, raised his voice against the Alliance, and strongly demanded her daughter to be discharged from service at once. However, as people say, no parents are strong enough to bend their child's will. Hanus, who would rather die than be discharged from service, persistently persuaded her father. In the end, she managed to get her father's approval, under the condition that she stays in the military only as an instructor that doesn't participate in battles. Currently, Hanus thinks that her life as an instructor is not too bad at all, but deep inside, she still yearns to return to battlefields. Inside the Command Center, she silently awaits for the day when she will finally stand on the battlefield with comrades whom she taught.",

    "story": "At one point, Hanus, in a greatly enraged state, utilized all of her knowledge and skills she possessed to craft this enigmatic firearm. She uses this weapon against a target who makes her angry. This deadly weapon named Hanus Type-0 is loaded with special bullets that corrodes the target's body upon hit. Not only that, this weapon also fires a tracking bullet now and then, making it impossible for a target to escape Hanus. If anyone could create this intricate firearm other than Hanus, perhaps it would be geniuses such as the head researcher of Magos Le'Flamme, or the one regarded as the famous genius technomagi of Orvel. The story behind the creation of this weapon is an interesting tale to tell. In the past, when Hanus was achieving much with her feat, she was assigned to a smuggler elimination operation. During the mission, the ringleader of the smuggling connection insulted Hanus whilst escaping the scene: 'The children's playground is over there. You should go and play a war game with your friends instead.' Enraged to the max, Hanus fought with everything she had, but Hanus had to retreat due to the sheer number of bodyguards protecting the ringleader. Hanus was enraged for days over the fact that she had allowed the criminal who insulted her to escape right in front of her. Then, on the day of the follow-up operation to eliminate the smuggling connection, Hanus brought this strange gun to the mission. On that very day, one shot from her gun concluded the elimination operation. As she shot her gun, she said to herself: 'It's play time.'"

Although Hanus had been recruited by the army due to her ingenious craftsmanship, she had to endure all sorts of insults and neglections that were directed to her, just because she was young. Amidst the hardships however, there was one person who recognized Hanus' ability for the first time. Starting from then, as time went by, more and more soldiers started to recognize Hanus as their comrades, or even something more than that. To Hanus, this person was someone precious, and grateful. However, their friendship came to a temporary halt when Hanus had to change position within the army. Seeing Hanus cry for the first time, this comrade smiled gently and gave her hat to Hanus which she had worn in battles as a token of friendship and respect. She promised to see each other again on the battlefield, where both of them fought so hard together."

      "story": "The first firearm that Hanus modified in her earlier days. It is then when Hanus' ingenuity first surfaced. While playing with blades and firearms, she remembered her father's big gun which was kept inside her father's room. Hanus' father once told her that despite its great firepower, the gun was ultimately deemed unsuitable for combat due to its massive weight. When Hanus saw the gun however, she felt that the gun could be modified appropriately. After contemplating for some time, she sneaked the gun from her father's room. After a few days, the gun was successfully modified into a tiny gun that fits Hanus. Hanus' father scolded her harshly for touching his gun without permission, but he could not hide his surprise when he saw the modified gun. Even though the gun's weight had been dramatically decreased, its firepower remained the same. After seeing this insane weapon, Hanus' father felt that her daughter's craftmanship is something extraordinary. Even more amazing is the fact that all this took place when Hanus was just 5 years old."
