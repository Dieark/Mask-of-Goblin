  "story": "They say there are those who go by the title, Master Chef. It is a title given only to the best chefs who created a new paradigm in the history of cooking. This rare book not only contains the best recipes in the world, but also contains information on how one can obtain the ingredients that are used in those recipes. The book of course, also explains how challenging and dangerous it is to find those ingredients... One interesting fact is that the signature dish of the first master chef who wrote this book is a sandwich."
