  "story": "A dessert made by using the gelatin of a Slime. Mixed with the juice of fruit, sugar, and other sweeteners, all it takes to finish it is to heat the mixture and cool it down. Juno did not want the dessert to be named after her since it was made of monsters, but Yanne has secretly added Juno's name on the menu... Beware- this dessert may turn back to a slime if left unattended."
